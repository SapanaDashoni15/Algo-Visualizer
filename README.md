# Algo-Visualizer
Ever wondered how does the algorithms which we use for sorting using different teachniques sort in backend.
If yes then I have got your back. I had made sorting simulation for different algorithms to simulate the process of sorting.
This file contains code for sorting algorithm.

Visualisation made - Bubble sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, DFS, Dikstra algorithm

This project showcases an efficient way to Visualise what we had learnt to had a deep understandings of the algorithms which we are learning
